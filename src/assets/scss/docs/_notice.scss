 * Read Me First
 *
 * WordPress requires a style.css stylesheet in the root directory of the theme,
 * not in a subdirectory. So here is the reference stylesheet for the WSU HRS
 * child theme. However, **this stylesheet IS NOT USED on the site itself.**
 * This is simply a human-readable version generated by the Sass build process.
 * (See the README file for more information).
 *
 * The actual stylesheet for the HRS Child Theme is a minified, human-unreadable
 * version at: `assets/css/style.css`. If you want to make changes to the CSS
 * of this theme you need to edit the .scss files found in `src/assets/scss/`
 * then run the Sass npm build process.
